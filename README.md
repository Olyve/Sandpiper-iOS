# Sandpiper iOS

Because of the way way Apple Music works, the only way to currently link your account is to use your physical iOS device to log in. The app's current functionality will only include linking your account. In future updates, we will be bringing the rest of the web functionality to the iOS app experience!

### Current Features
- Link your Apple Music Account

### Planned Updates
- Link your Spotify Account
- Playlist transfers
